# DiscordBot
This was a pet project I worked on during the Fall semester.

I'm a regular Discord user and I saw that other people had created bots for their servers that had a lot of features so I wanted to try it out too.

I used discord.py and followed a tutorial series for the project and there are two commands so far- ping and 8ball.

"ping" responds "pong" as well as the latency and 8ball randomly generates some 8ball quote. 

I have not been working on this recently but I as the filename suggests, I could've changed the 8ball function to display random jokes. 

I learned async from this project as well as what accessing APIs might be like.
